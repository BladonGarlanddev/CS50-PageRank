# What I learned

## Transition Models
I learned that transition models define the potential states and thier respective probabilities of occuring. 

## Sampling
I learned that due to the computational cost of an iterative approach, sampling is used as a approximation of the true probabilities.

#Syntax
I learned the _ syntax in for loops
